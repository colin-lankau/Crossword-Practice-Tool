# Crossword Practice Tool

A plan for this to be a tool to be useful for those wanting to get better at NYT crosswords.

## Current Features

- Scrape.py - web scrapes for answer clue data
- DatabaseFunctions.py - Manages and updates database and backups
- miniBoard.py - class for 5x5 board, contains algorithm for generation

## TODO

- Improve backtracking algorithm, make it smarter
- Implement a random puzzle shape to the miniBoard class
- Once miniBoard puzzle creation is working (efficiently), expand base algorithm for 15x15 puzzle
- Possibly turn into a django or flask application, set up with user registration, and many features for practicing crossword solving
