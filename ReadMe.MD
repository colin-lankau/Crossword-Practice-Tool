# Crossword Practice Tool

A plan for this to be a tool to be useful for those wanting to get better at NYT crosswords.

## Current Features

- Web Scrapes crossword data for the current day's NYT crossword puzzle
- Basic Board class to store crossword information and possibly rebuild the puzzle into a playable version

## TODO

- Write backtracking algorithm to dynamically build crossword puzzles from database of clues and answers
- Integrate with a database of crossword clues and answers I have from 1991-2019
- Have the daily puzzle's clues and answers update the database daily
- Once this is working, turn into a django application, set up with user registration, and many features for practicing crossword solving
